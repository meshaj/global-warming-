# List of 5 Claims
 ### 1. Claim 1
[Coral Recoveries and Growth Show The Hill Is Misleading About Global Warming Killing Reefs](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/17/coral-recoveries-and-growth-show-the-hill-is-misleading-about-global-warming-killing-reefs/)

The claim here is that coral reefs are, in reality, in perfect condition and have survived much worse in terms of climate conditions in years past. They argue that we are using only a couple of decades of data when there are millions of years that have passed that have had harsher climates. 

This prompted me to rethink my views, as I have never considered that coral reefs survived hotter eras like the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Although we have solidified information over the past couple of decades, there are many years of climate shift that I do not know anything about. 


### 2. Claim 2
[Many Factors Affect Climate](https://climatechange101.ca/many-factors-affect-climate/)

The claim that many factors affect the climate and global warming, such as atmospheric oscillations from large bodies of water like El Niño (discussed in class), which are able to shift the climate for a lot of the world, depending on how hot the body of water is. Because these “recurrent patterns” last 2 to 7 years, it is unreasonable to conclude that extended periods of global warming are confirmation that the warming is actually permanent and irreversible. 


This prompted me to rethink my views, as throughout they refer to these processes as “natural phenomenon,” implying that the Earth has continued to go through these repeated cycles that last long periods of time. There has definitely been more awareness being brought up within the past 2-7 years regarding climate change, leading me to think that the commotion has been a fad over a natural phenomenon. 

### 3. Claim 3
[The Hottest Summer Days in D.C. Have Not Gotten Hotter in Last 40 Years](https://www.drroyspencer.com/2025/09/the-hottest-summer-days-in-d-c-have-not-gotten-hotter-in-last-40-years/)

The claim in this article is that although we consider global warming to be reflected in our hottest summer day temperatures, they have actually stayed consistent over the years, and our coldest days of the year are getting colder.

This prompted me to rethink my views as usually when I hear news about the warmest day of the year getting warmer, I’ve heard it on the news or from credible sources. However, this article mentions raw “un-adjusted” data, and that has been recorded since 1985. So this made me question how that data was actually being recorded and if there is a standard that needs to be taken into consideration when claiming that. 

### 4. Claim 4

[Wrong, Daily Mail, Global Warming is Not Spiraling Out of Control](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/03/30/wrong-daily-mail-global-warming-is-not-spiraling-out-of-control/)

This article is critiquing a computer model created by The Globe and Mail that they have used to predict the effects of CO2 levels on global warming within the coming years. The article claims that these news sources are misleading the public and overstating the effects of climate change when, in reality, they are not that serious. 

This prompted me to reconsider my views, as they are discrediting a usually credible source and quoted a member of the Globe and Mail explaining that their claims are not always as serious as they seem, and some things, like sea level, have not changed since 1850. 


### 5. Claim 5

[The Global Temperature Record Says We Are in a ‘Climate Emergency’](https://wattsupwiththat.com/the-global-temperature-record-says-we-are-in-a-climate-emergency/)

This article argues that if you were to normalize the data when we look at graphs of the climate temperature, it is a lot less threatening. They demonstrate this using NASA GISS data, which comes down to whether the source has an “alarmist” attitude or not

This prompted me to reconsider my views, as all the article is doing is rescaling the data that NASA provides, not falsifying any of their own. This leads me to believe that it potentially benefits these companies in some way to make the state of the climate sound a lot worse than it is. 


# Evaluating Claim #1
<dl></dl>
  <dt>(Leuken 2025), discusses the validity of the claim that Coral Reefs are being destroyed by global warming. Luken begins the article by critiquing another article in The Hill, which is a US political website, that supposedly claims catastrophic, anthropogenic causes of climate change are damaging coral reefs beyond repair. She goes on to argue that this claim is objectively false, and explains that the Hill published an article in years earlier that contradicts their own claim, and cites sources that state that there has been record-breaking coral coverage in recent years. She also concludes that coral reefs have survived much hotter conditions, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was likely more detrimental to coral reefs than the temperatures now. All this for Leuken to say that the goal of the Hill in publishing this article was to frighten its readers into ignoring Trump’s point.
    This topic is of particular interest to these news sources as it is to the public. This is because global warming and the damage to coral reefs have been among the longest-standing pieces of evidence that our Earth is dying and struggling to recover. Assessing this article using the five principles for evaluating information sources, it becomes clear that this article is just as much of an opinion as the article the author is critiquing. 
    The purpose of this paper is not necessarily to make a logically sound point; rather, she is attempting to disprove another person’s point. More specifically, it is to persuade against a particular political stance. The article begins and ends with talking about President Trump’s beliefs about climate change, and how a certain news source has been responding to his claims. The intended audience is the general public, without any specialized information. 
This author works for the Heartland Institute, which is a conservative libertarian non-profit organization that is well known for its opposition to scientific claims of climate change. The author herself has a bachelor's of engineering and a minor in geology with no subject matter expertise. Neither Watts Up with That nor Heartland Institute is a peer-reviewed journal, nor are they prestigious or highly regarded sources in North America. Thus, the consequences of relaying false information are relatively low. The information she uses in her paper comes from Nature articles, but she quotes them incorrectly or has only looked at the title. For example, she cites a paper about the resiliency of coral reefs in France, which actually states that the mortality rate of coral reefs is statistically significant and the trajectory of the recovering reefs cannot be applied to other areas, exhibiting a clear case of decay. Out of seven coral reefs sampled, less than half were able to make any sort of recovery (Vercelloni et al. 2019). The only time she claims coral reefs are making a large-scale recovery is when she cites herself in another journal that has no credibility as well. Her information is not scientific, nor is it correct, and it is very politically charged. 
    In terms of her claim about coral reefs surviving the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal maximum, it is a valid concern, but her point is not backed up by the right claim and is poorly researched. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum lasted at least 200,000 years, allowing for adaptation and resilience to form, although there may have been minor coral loss (Bosellini et al. 2025). The current acidification of our oceans and rising thermal temperatures are too intense to allow for the same adaptation and thus are becoming detrimental (Pandolfi et al. 2011). 

# Reflection
One thing I noticed throughout the articles I read is that authors are quick to correct other journal articles that are not necessarily credible sources. The claims that are being thrown back and forth are not about _Nature_ or _Science_. They’re about articles that have been published in political journals or third-party blogs. Even if they were critiquing sources like _NASA_, the authors who were doing the data “re-adjusting” or talking about the “raw data” likely have no connection to this very credible source, and no credibility to themselves as they modify this data, as none of these sources were peer reviewed. Whether these authors would like to admit it or not, their logic is not scientifically sound, and their arguments are very opinion-based. Their audiences are not people who would be able to refute their claims, and often they take advantage of that by appearing to offer sources and data that have been misconstrued to convince their audience, who would not bother to check where it was pulled from.
